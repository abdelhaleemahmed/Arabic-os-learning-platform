        title: "‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions",
        q1: {
            question: "What if the Arabic OS doesn't boot?",
            answer: "Ensure that: 1) The floppy image file is not corrupted, 2) Boot order is set to floppy first, 3) Floppy drive is properly connected in VM settings, 4) VM has sufficient memory allocated (minimum 16MB)."
        },
        q2: {
            question: "Can I run this on real hardware?",
            answer: "Yes! You can write the floppy image to a physical floppy disk or USB drive (with proper tools) and boot from real x86 hardware. Make sure the target hardware supports floppy boot or USB legacy boot."
        },
        q3: {
            question: "Which emulator is best for beginners?",
            answer: "VirtualBox is recommended for beginners due to its user-friendly GUI and extensive documentation. QEMU is great for quick testing, while Bochs is ideal for development and debugging."
        },
        q4: {
            question: "Why does the OS look different in each emulator?",
            answer: "Different emulators may have slightly different video card emulations, timing, and hardware configurations. The core functionality should remain the same, but visual presentation might vary slightly."
        },
        q5: {
            question: "How can I take screenshots or record the session?",
            answer: "Most emulators support screenshots: VirtualBox (Host+E), VMware (VM menu ‚Üí Capture Screen), QEMU (monitor command 'screendump'), Bochs (built-in screenshot feature). You can also use external screen recording software."
