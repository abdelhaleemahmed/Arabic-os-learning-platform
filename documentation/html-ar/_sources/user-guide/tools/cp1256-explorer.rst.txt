CP1256 Character Encoding Explorer
===================================

The CP1256 Character Encoding Explorer is an interactive educational tool designed to help you understand the CP1256 (Windows-1256) character encoding system, which has been widely used for Arabic text representation in computing systems.

Overview
========

CP1256, also known as Windows-1256, is a single-byte character encoding that was designed to support Arabic script alongside Latin characters. Despite being largely superseded by UTF-8, CP1256 remains important for understanding legacy systems and the evolution of Arabic computing.

Key Learning Objectives
=======================

By using this tool, you will learn:

* How single-byte character encodings work
* The structure and organization of the CP1256 character set

Practical Exercises
===================

Exercise 1: Character Hunt
-------------------------

Use the interactive map to find specific characters:

1. Locate the Arabic letter "ص" (Sad)
2. Find its CP1256 code (decimal and hexadecimal)
3. Identify the corresponding Unicode code point
4. Compare the byte representation with UTF-8

**Expected Results:**
* CP1256: 213 (0xD5)
* Unicode: U+0635
* UTF-8: 0xD8 0xB5 (two bytes)

Exercise 2: Text Encoding Analysis
----------------------------------

Analyze how a common Arabic phrase is encoded:

**Text to analyze**: "مرحبا" (Hello)

1. Enter the text in the analysis panel
2. Record the CP1256 byte sequence
3. Note any encoding issues or limitations
4. Compare with the UTF-8 representation

Exercise 3: Legacy Migration Scenario
------------------------------------

Simulate a real-world migration scenario:

1. Identify characters that exist in CP1256 but require multiple bytes in UTF-8
2. Find Unicode characters that cannot be represented in CP1256
3. Analyze the implications for legacy data migration
4. Propose strategies for handling encoding conversion

Common Issues and Solutions
===========================

Character Display Problems
--------------------------

**Problem**: Arabic text displays as question marks or boxes

**Causes**:
* Missing Arabic font support
* Incorrect character encoding detection
* Legacy system limitations

**Solutions**:
* Ensure proper font installation
* Specify character encoding explicitly
* Use encoding detection tools

**Code Example**:

.. code-block:: html

   <!-- Ensure proper encoding declaration -->
   <meta charset="windows-1256">

   <!-- Alternative for UTF-8 systems -->
   <meta charset="utf-8">

Text Direction Issues
--------------------

**Problem**: Arabic text displays left-to-right instead of right-to-left

**Causes**:
* Missing RTL direction specification
* Browser default handling
* CSS direction conflicts

**Solutions**:

.. code-block:: css

   /* Ensure proper text direction */
   .arabic-text {
       direction: rtl;
       text-align: right;
       font-family: 'Traditional Arabic', serif;
   }

Migration Challenges
-------------------

**Problem**: Data corruption during CP1256 to UTF-8 conversion

**Prevention Strategies**:
* Always backup original data
* Use verified conversion tools
* Test conversion with sample data
* Validate character mapping accuracy

Real-world Applications

   const charInfo = CP1256Explorer.getCharacterInfo(0xD5);
   console.log(charInfo);
   // Output: { char: "ص", decimal: 213, hex: "D5", unicode: "U+0635" }

   // Convert text to CP1256 byte array
   const bytes = CP1256Explorer.encodeText("مرحبا");
   console.log(bytes);
   // Output: [227, 209, 205, 200, 199]

   // Validate CP1256 character
   const isValid = CP1256Explorer.isValidCharacter(0xD5);
   console.log(isValid); // Output: true

**Python Integration:**

.. code-block:: python

   import codecs

   # Encode Arabic text to CP1256
   arabic_text = "مرحبا"
   cp1256_bytes = arabic_text.encode('cp1256')
   print([hex(b) for b in cp1256_bytes])

   # Decode CP1256 bytes back to text
   decoded_text = cp1256_bytes.decode('cp1256')
   print(decoded_text)
